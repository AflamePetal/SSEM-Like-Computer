This is how to make it run:
1.First you should program the computer in a .asm file
  -The first instruction(00:) is not considered duo the fact that the program counter increments at first, to start to read from line-1(01:).
  -For getting to know how to program the computer see the examples in AsmFiles folder.

2.Then you need to assemble the .asm file you've programmed and created.
  -Refere to one of the C or CPP folders. both programs in C and C++ are the assemblers(The C program is more readable).
  -TO USE IT: you need to open the .c or .cpp files and change the FILE_NAME macro to what ever the location and name of your file is.
  -To use the resulting hexadecimal code in logisim, change the FOR_LOGISIM macro to true.

3.You'll then get a machineCode.txt file which you should add(load) its codes into the computer's RAM.

*To make it comfortable to yourself, run the assembler for Add.asm file first, to get the gist of the whole process.
